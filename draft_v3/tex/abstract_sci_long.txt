We study the pricing, design, and desirability of sovereign state-contingent debt instruments. In a standard model of sovereign default augmented with lenders who fear model misspecification, we find that the commonly used threshold bond structure (e.g., the GDP-linked bond issued by Argentina in 2005) leads to welfare losses for the government. While this bond would be beneficial when facing rational-expectations lenders, its threshold structure increases the variance of promised returns, which lenders with robustness dislike. The probability distortions applied by robust lenders lead to high uncertainty premia in line with observed prices, rationalizing what an earlier literature has labeled as novelty premium. Finally, we characterize the optimal design of state-contingent debt when facing robust lenders and show that it still leads to welfare gains. Our findings tie the lack of popularity of sovereign state-contingent debt instruments to the particular design used thus far.
