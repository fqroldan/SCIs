We analyze the consequences of sovereign state-contingent debt when foreign lenders have concerns for model misspecification. In standard sovereign default models, state-contingent debt improves the issuing government's welfare but spreads are counterfactually low for common repayment structures (such as the GDP-linked bond issued by Argentina in 2005). Our robust-lenders model generates ambiguity premia which explain most of what the literature has called novelty premium. Realistic spreads lead to welfare losses, explaining the scarce use of these instruments in practice. Finally, we characterize the optimal design of state-contingent debt and how it varies with robustness.
