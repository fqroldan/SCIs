We analyze how concerns for model misspecification by international lenders affect the benefits of state-contingent sovereign debt instruments. For the commonly used threshold structure (e.g., Argentina 2005), our model generates ambiguity premia that match observed bond prices. While the government would benefit from such a bond when facing rational expectations lenders, this additional source of premia leads to welfare losses with robust lenders. Finally, we show how the optimal design of the state-contingent bond varies with the level of robustness. Our findings rationalize the little use of these instruments in practice and shed light on their optimal design.
